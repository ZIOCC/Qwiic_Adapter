#### Description

This useful little board will help you connect non-Qwiic-enabled boards with Qwiic-enabled modules.

Just solder your desired standard-pitch four-pin header to the board, and you’ve tapped into the Qwiic bus for breadboarding or connecting directly to modules without Qwiic connectors built in.

Two Qwiic connectors are set up for direct daisy-chaining with the attached module.
